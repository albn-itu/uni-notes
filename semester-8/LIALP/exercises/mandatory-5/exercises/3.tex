\section{Exercise 3}
\question{
	A man walks in the woods with his two dogs and gets lost. He comes to a fork in the road and knows that each dog will choose the fork that takes him home with probability p independently of the other. He decides that if both dogs choose the same direction he will follow that. Otherwise, he will choose a fork at random. What is his probability of choosing the right fork with this strategy? How does it compare to the strategy of picking one dog in advance, and following that? Explain your reasoning using the laws of probability (especially those concerning conditional probability) as carefully as you can.
