\section{Exercise 2}
\question{
	A covid test center can test 82 patients in an hour. On average 1 in 5 patients do not show for an appointment, so the test center books 100 patients an hour. Use the normal approximation of the binomial to approximate the probability that 82 patients or more arrive for the first hour of testing. You should not use continuity correction, so just compute the probability of $>$ 82 patients arriving. What is the probability that 164 patients or more arrive for the first 2 hours? Management decides that the probability that the number of patients arriving in a day is equal to or larger than the capacity should not exceed $10\%$. Suppose the test center still accepts 100 patient bookings for each openning hour, how many hours should the center be open each day to ensure that managements goal is met. Again you should use the normal approximation to compute an approximation. \textit{Hint:} Start by generalising your solution to the first two problems to a formula for computing the probability that $>$ 82k patients arrive in k hours
