\section{Exercise 7}
\question{
	An ice cream shop sells three flavours of ice cream, which we will simply refer to as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Customers can choose between 1,2 and 3 scoops of ice cream in each cup. Alice likes all the three flavours and is totally undecided as she enters the shop. She decides to make a uniform choice of cup size (1,2 or 3 scoops) and after that, a uniform choice of flavours of ice cream for the cup, making sure that she will choose at most one scoop of each flavour. In other words, if she chooses a cup for 2 scoops, then any of the three flavour combinations $ab$, $ac$ and $bc$ are equally likely. Let $A$, $B$, $C$ denote the events that flavours $a$,$b$ and $c$, respectively appear in the cup Alice buys. Let $X_2$ be the event that she chooses a cup for two scoops.
}

\subsection{Part a}
\question{
	Are $A$ and $B$ independent?
}

First we can conclude that:
\[
	P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Then we can conclude that:
\begin{align*}
	P(A|X_1) & = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9} \\
	P(A|X_2) & = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{9} \\
	P(A|X_3) & = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\end{align*}

These count for $B$ and $C$ too.

Then we can conclude that:
\[
	P(A) = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{2}{9} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{2}{9} + \frac{3}{9} = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

This is the same for $B$ and $C$.

Then we can calculate $P(A \cap B)$:
\begin{align*}
	P(A\cap B|X_1) & = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 0 = 0                                                 \\
	P(A\cap B|X_2) & = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}                             \\
	P(A\cap B|X_3) & = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{1}{3}                             \\
	P(A \cap B)    & = 0 + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{3}{9} = \frac{4}{9}
\end{align*}

We can then check independence by checking if $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$:
\[
	\frac{4}{9} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9}
\]

So $A$ and $B$ are independent

\section{Part b}
\question{
	Are $A$ and $B$ independent conditional on $X_2$? Argue mathematically for your answer.
}

We already have $P(A|X_2) = P(B|X_2) = \frac{2}{9}$ so we must calculate $P(A|X_2 \cap B|X_2) = P(A\cap B|X_2)$. Which we actually also have, so:
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{9} & = \frac{2}{9} \cdot \frac{2}{9} \\
	\frac{1}{9} & = \frac{4}{9}                   \\
\end{align*}

So $A$ and $B$ are not independent conditional on $X_2$.

\section{Part c}
\question{
	Later that summer on a sunny day, the ice cream shop is all out of flavours $b$ and $c$, and only sells flavour $a$. Despite that being clearly marked at the shop, 16 customers are waiting in line. Experience shows that each customer will want 2 scoops of ice cream a with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ and 3 scoops with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. No customers will choose just one scoop. There is only ice cream left for 37 scoops.\\[1ex]

	Use the normal approximation of the binomial to estimate the probability that there is enough ice cream for all 16 customers in the queue.
}

Let $S$ be the number of scoops of ice cream sold. Then $S_i$ is the number of scoops sold to customer $i$. This can be modelled as a boolean of whether the customer wants 2 or 3 scoops.

We can then calculate the mean and variance of $S_i$:
\begin{align*}
	E[S_i]   & = 2\frac{1}{2} + 3\frac{1}{2} = 2.5              \\
	Var(S_i) & = 2^2\frac{1}{2} + 3^2\frac{1}{2} - 2.5^2 = 0.25
\end{align*}

Then we can define the value $S$ as
\[
	S = \sum^16_{i=1} S_i
\]

And the mean and variance of $S$ is:
\begin{align*}
	E[S]   & = 16 \cdot 2.5 = 40 \\
	Var(S) & = 16 \cdot 0.25 = 4
\end{align*}

To calculate the probability we must use the central limit theorem. It formulates as
\[
	Z_n = \frac{S_n - E[S_n]}{\sqrt{Var(S_n)}}
\]

We want to calculate $P(S\leq 37)$ so $S_n$ is 37. We can then calculate $Z_n$:
\[
	Z_n = \frac{37 - 40}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{-3}{2} = -1.5
\]

This leaves us with the probability $P(Z_n \leq -1.5) = \Phi(-1.5)$. We can then look up the value in a normal distribution table, which is $0.0668$. So the probability that there is enough ice cream for all 16 customers in the queue is $0.0668$.

\section{Part d}
\question{
	Even later that summer, the ice cream shop sells 5 different flavours, which we refer to as $a$,$b$,$c$,$d$,$e$. Bob wants a cup with 2 scoops, and will choose uniformly among the flavours, making sure not to choose the same flavour twice. Let $YA$ and $YB$ be the Bernoulli random variables associated with the events that Bob’s ice cream contains flavours $a$ and $b$ respectively.\\[1ex]

	Compute the mean and variance of $YA$, and the covariance of $YA$ and $YB$ .
