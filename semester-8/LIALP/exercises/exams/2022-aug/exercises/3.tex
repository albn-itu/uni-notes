\section{Exercise 3}
For this question, consider the matrices
\begin{align*}
	A & = \begin{bmatrix}
		      4 & -1 \\
		      1 & 2
	      \end{bmatrix} &
	B & = \begin{bmatrix}
		      3 & 1 \\
		      0 & 2
	      \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
and consider the set
\[
	V = \left\{C\in Mat_{2,2} | AC=BC\right\}
\]

where $Mat_{2,2}$ is the set of all $2\times 2$ matrices.

\subsection{Part a}
\question{
	Is $V$ a subspace of $Mat_{2,2}$?
}

To check if $V$ is a subspace we must check if it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

Consider $C_1$ and $C_2$. Then $AC_1 = BC_1$ and $AC_2 = BC_2$. We want to show that $A(C_1 + C_2) = B(C_1 + C_2)$.

We can expand to get:
\[
	A(C_1 + C_2) = AC_1 + AC_2 = BC_1 + BC_2 = B(C_1 + C_2)
\]

Thus $V$ is closed under addition.

Consider $C\in V$ and a scalar $k$. We want to show that $A(kC) = B(kC)$.
We know that $A(kC) = kAC$ and $B(kC) = kBC$. Since $AC = BC$ we can conclude that $A(kC) = k(BC) = B(kC)$. So it's closed under multiplication
