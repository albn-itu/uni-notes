# Feedback - Lecture 4
Thank you for the lecture, apologize for the inappropriate feedback method that was done in the end. This feedback was written by 7 students.

## The topic
It wasn't entirely clear what the topic or purpose of the lecture was. We've had a few lectures about Turing machines and the halting problem in the Discrete Mathematics course before, so we don't really know why we had to go through it again. Even after the lecture i don't know what the purpose or relevance to the rest of course was.

## The subject
The subject was very complicated, and quite philosophical, which sadly resulted in mentally losing some students. Something that would definetly have helped was small, concise, examples of the concepts. Fx. in Discrete Mathematics we were shown an animation of the Entscheidungsproblem, which really helped understanding. In the same vein the "I am lying" was a really good, small and simple example. 

I think my main critique was that things were explained too fast and convoluted. I believe the subject could have been explained simpler, despite the complexity of the subject.

## The Turing machine
It would be nice to have some context for what the Turing machine worked before we start computing. What is the start state, and what is the machine doing? It was incredibly confusing, and time consuming to watch without any context. Also we did understand the concept after first few states.

There seemed to be a few times where you stopped and seemed confused, or lost. I just want to show some support if you are going through a hard time, it happens to all of us and the behavior of the student in the end was truly unacceptable to do in front of the entire auditorium.
