# Exam Guidance
## ILO
- Remember them, and include them
- Identify and account for key, select positions in the Philosophy of Science
  - Explicitly mention elements and positions of philosophy of Science. For example if you write about something and there is a clear ethical element of POS, mention it, to prove you know it and can use that theory.
- Account for relevant theoretical perspectives on technology with a particular emphasis on the interactions between IT, the general BA subject area and the broader context.
  - Literally just what the exam is
  - The topic has to be IT related, and it has to be examined in the exam, with relevant theory.
- Identify and analyze a problem of interest that touches upon the relationships between IT and its context (may it be of political, ethical, philosophical, historical or societal nature).
  - 
- Present relevant concepts from the curriculum accurately, and critically use these concepts in an investigation of the select problem

## Formalia
- 10-12 pages
- Include your thinking process, not just the conclusion
- There will be dedicated exercise units for Guidance

Process:
- Find an IT problem (AI, selfdriven cars, biohacking, social media, crypto, decentralized networks, military tech, military -> civilian tech, the not so safe infrastructure ala skyggekrigen)
- Analyze it

## Structure
- Title
  - Required
  - Suprisingly important
  - Should refresh your memory and make it easy to remember the paper
- Abstract
  - Optional
  - Write last
  - Can sway the grade, since it's the only thing read during the grade discussion
  - Counts towards page count
- Introduction
  - Required
  - The hook, why is this paper important?
  - Establish shared understanding, and introduce the problem.
- Literature review
  - Required
  - Doesn't have to be a section, can be part of text.
  - What has previously been written about this problem?
  - Present the sate of the art on the problem
  - Use Google Scholar
  - If you have too much literature, go with the one with the most citations.
  - Use some literature on both sides of the problem.
  - Only academic papers
  - Remember citations
  - Good idea: Classify literature into different categories, so that you can present the overall points without presenting every paper individually.
- Methodology
  - Required
  - There are many different methodologies, so its important to state definitions, models and methods used in the paper i write.
  - You can modify the definitions models and methods, but you have to explain how you did that.
  - How did you fit them into my specific problem.
  - Are there some problematic aspects of the methods used? Explain those problems in the discussions section.
- Results
  - Varies greatly depending on the subject matter
  - Strategy 1: Dont try to solve things, just provide new information regarding the problem
  - Strategy 2: Try to help fix the problem, provide a solution
  - Strategy 3: Try to help understand the problem better. For example if 2 terms have the same or different meanings, but people dont realise this and are talking past each other.
- Discussion
  - Required
  - Show how your results relate to previous work, such as the literature you discussed
  - Discuss further implications showing new paths to go for future research
  - Anticipate possible counterargents
  - State the significance of your own paper?
  - Can be merged with results
- Visualisations
  - Not required
  - Do not be afraid of tables, data and graphs. UNLESS THEY DO NOT ADD VALUE
  - Every visualisation has to be described with figure text
  - If it's easier with text, use text, otherwise use visualisations. 
  - The caption would count, but the image doesnt count towards page size?
- Illustrations
  - Remember copyright
  - Do not reproduce without asking for permission, use the original work
- Citations
  - Avoid long passages, except for definitions or claims you wish to analyze it.
