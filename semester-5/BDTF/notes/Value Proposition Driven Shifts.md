# Value Proposition Driven Shifts
Radical shift in the value created for customers

## Patterns
### From Product to Recurring Service
Move from selling a physical product to providing a service.

### From Low Tech to High Tech
Move from a low tech labor intensive product to creating a technology driven product.

Examples could be Dagens farm.

### From Sales to Platform
Move from selling a product to providing a platform for others to sell on.

Look at CoolShop for example.
