# Evidence

There are 2 different types of evidence:

- Weak Evidence
  - Opinions and beliefs
    - Vaccines......
  - What people say
    - People may say something and do something completely different. Fx. people like the idea of alot of color, but not actually wearing it.
  - Lab settings
    - Things in a sterile controlled environment, may not act in the same way in the real world. Ex. Samsung Note 7
  - Small investments
    - If customers are willing to use a lot of money there is evidence for the product being attractive, but otherwise the product may be quite weak if the investments are small. This also counts for investors themselves. Kickstarter can be a good place to check out stuff like this.
- Strong Evidence
  - Facts
  - What people do
  - Real world settings
  - Large investments

Different experiment create different strengths of evidence, make sure you pick the right one.
