# Experiment Pitfalls
Even the best experiment plans can fail. Here are some common pitfalls to avoid.

- Time trap
  - Don't force timelines that make the experiment suffer
- Analysis Paralysis
  - Don't keep Analysing instead of validating and experimenting more
- Incomparable Data/Evidence
  - Correlation does not imply causation. Look at the Nicolas Cage Swimming Pool chart
- Weak Data/Evidence
  - Don't realy on what people say. Dig deeper and look at what they do.
- Too Few experiments
  - One experiment can lie, do multiple experiments to validate
- Confirmation bias
  - Don't do the experiments in a echo chamber. And look at the evidence objectively
- Failure to learn and adapt
  - Just ignoring the experiments. Change according to what the data tells you, even if you don't like the results.
- Outsource testing
  - Doing the experiments on your own provides more value, some outsourcing may not have the skills you need.
