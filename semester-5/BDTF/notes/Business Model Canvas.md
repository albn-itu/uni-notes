# Business Model Canvas
Like a canvas to paint on. Made to describe and invent new business models.

## Elements
Below is each element quickly described.

TODO: A note for each of these, that is more fleshed out.

### Customer sgements
Who

### Value propositions
What are you delivering?

### Channels
How do you reach the customer segment with your project?

### Customer relationships
How is your relationship with the customer? Personal? Non-personal? Automated? Personal automation?

How do you get, keep and grow your customers.

### Revenue streams
What are the customer segments willing to pay, and how? How you earn money?

### Key resources
What resources do i need to create value? Such as servers, material, factories etc.

### Key activities
What do we need to excel at to create value? Management? Development? Maintanence?

### Key partners
In addition to suppliers, who are the key partners that can make your business model bigger? Such as social media companies that can increase your customer base?

### Cost structure
The combination of all the key things, do you actually earn money with all these things? Where does the money come from, and where does it all go?

## Special cases for public and non profit organisations
Revenue streams are usually from donors and not at all or partially from customers.

One example: ITU which is paid by the state. So that's technically everyone, which also includes the "customers" (students). That is a weird case with state organisations. You pay taxes from your pay, which indirectly pays your pay.

## Approaches
### Checklist
Looking at the blocks individually. Not very good.

### Only looking at innovation or new customer segments
This would overlook new methods and make you open for front/back stage disruption and profit formulat disruptions.

### No testing approach
Being so happy about you idea that you make business plans instead of just testing the product, which would maybe show it failing or showing new methods and models that you could use to disrupt the existing market.
