# Definition
# Business Model Canvas
Like a canvas to paint on. Made to describe and invent new business models.

## Elements
Below is each element quickly described.

### Customer Segments
> An organization serves one or several Customer Segments

A customer segment is the customers you are delivering value to. There are different types of Customer Segments:

- Mass market
  - No real distinguishing characteristics, you are delivering to pretty much everyone.
- Niche market
  - Cater to a very specific type of people
- Segmented
  - Multiple different segments, such as banks that can focus on both rich and poor customers.
- Diversified
  - Cater to mutiple very different segments, such as Microsoft that sells both cloud computing and operating systems.
- Multi sided
  - Multiple sides of the same coin. Such as Car dealerships that both sell/buy from manufacturers and sell to customers.

### Value propositions
> It seeks to solve customer problems and satisfy customer needs with value propositions

Value propositions is what you are delivering. Your value proposition can stand out in the following ways:
- New product
  - New never before seen products is a great way.
- Performance.
  - An improved existing product or service, usually in perfomance is a pretty common way to stand out. See the entire PC component market.
- Customization
  - Customization of services.
- "Getting the job done"
  - Value can be created by simply getting something done for a customer, such as delivering an internet connection.
- Design
  - Design can be an important way to stand out, but is hard to measure.
- Brand/status
  - Brand/status is also hard to measure but it can be a value for customers to simply own something from a brand, such as Apple.
- Price
  - Offering something a lower price is also a good way to provide value. But it usually affects the rest of the model, as things have to be done cheaper.
- Cost Reduction
  - Help reduce costs, for example Dinero which helps removing the Accounting department
- Risk reduction
  - Providing some sort of guarantee that reduces the risk of a purchase
- Accessibility
  - Making a product available to a customer segment that previously couldn't get it. VPN's with streaming for example
- Convenience/usability
  - Make something easier to use, Terraform for example

### Channels
> Value propositions are delivered to customers through communication, distribution and sales Channels 

How a company communicates with customers, such as advertising. But also how they distribute, fx. download, shipping, personal handover. This channel also houses purchasing and after sales.

### Customer relationships
> Customer relationships are established and maintained with each Customer Segment

The type of relationships a company establishes with specific Customer Segments. These can be:
- Personal assistance
  - Get help from a real human during or after the sale.
- Dedicated personal assistance
  - Dedicate a customer representative to a specific customer. This develops over a long time. For example an accounting agency.
- Self-service
  - No direct relationship, the company just provides the customer with everything to help themselves.
- Automated services
  - Broad term, can both be automated customer service through AI and automated recommendations, such as Netflix does.
- Communities
  - Setup a place where a community can grow and support each other, such as Strava's forum
- Co-creation
  - Invite the customer to create content. Such as through reviews, or even make the entire platform about co-creation, such as YouTube.

### Revenue streams
> Revenue streams result from value propositions successfully offered to customers

Revenue streams is the money made from customers. Much be subtracted from Cost Structure to figure out earnings. Examples of revenue streams:

- Asset sale
  - Selling of goods, basically selling the rights to use a product.
- Usage fee
  - Selling use of a product or service. Such as a phone company taking money for using a product for a specific amount of time. Same with some cloud providers that sell for the amount of time used.
- Subscription fees
  - Selling access to a service, such as a streaming service
- Lending/Renting/Leasing
  - Created by temporarily granting access to some asset, such as cars.
- Licensing
  - Let customers pay for using some intellectual property for a time. Popular in streaming services paying for the license to show a movie.
- Brokerage fees
  - Taking a cut of a deal brokered between two parties. Dagens or Bitcoin exchanges are good examples.
- Advertising
  - Having ads running on your site, such as what Youtube does.
- Dynamic or fixed
  - Not a reveneue stream, but the way of determining pricing. Fixed is determined by the company and is usually listed or determined based on the product. Dynamic pricing can be negotiated, determined based on inventory, based on the market or during an Auction.
- Combined
  - These can all be combined, for example Let's Go takes lending fees on top of the subscription. Or Netflix advertising while taking a subscription fee.

### Key resources
> Key resources are the assets required to offer and deliver the previously described elements...

What resources do i need to create value? Examples:

- Physical
  - Facilities, buildings, materials, vehicles
- Intellectual
  - Brand, knowledge, patents, copyrights, partnerships, customers
  - Hard to develop but very valuable
- Human
  - You need people to do work. Especially necessary in development and creative businesses.
- Financial
  - Money is necessary for hiring, buying resources etc.

### Key activities
> ...by performing a number of Key Activities

What do we need to excel at to create value? Management? Development? Maintanence? Examples:

- Production
  - Designing, making and delivering the product
- Problem solving
  - Coming up with new solutions to customer problems. This is a common activity in hospitals, consultation and other services.
- Platform/network
  - Some businesses need platforms and networks, as that is their business model. Ebay or facebook for example do not function without their users.

### Key partners
> Some activities are outsourced and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise

Key partners are the suppliers and partners that are needed to make the model work. These can supply or perform Key Resources or Activities

- Optimization and economy of scale
  - Some partners can have the economy of scale on their side, while the mass production of that part may not make sense on your end. Or the gathering of material.
- Reduction of risk and uncertainty
  - Allying with a company can decrease your risk in a competetive environment. Take the new Matter association for example, ensuring compatability creates a closed group that provides a competetive edge.
- Acquisition of particular resources and activities
  - Some companies may want to outsource some activities or buying resources from others. Most Non-Iphones fx. use Android an OS not developed by the company, and many SSD manufacturers use chips from Samsung.

### Cost structure
> The business model elements result in the cost structure 

The cost of everything necessary to operate the business model. Below are some examples of cost structures:

- Cost-driven
  - Focusses on minimizing costs wherever possible. Examples could be an economy airline such as Ryan Air
- Value-driven
  - Focusses on the best value possible. Examples are luxury hotels
- Fixed costs
  - Prefers fixed costs compared to varying the cost based on volume. Manufacturing companies often do this.
- Variable costs
  - Costs that vary based on volume.
- Economies of scale
  - Costs go down as volume goes up. Such as materials in manufacturing.
- Economies of scope
  - Costs go down as operations increase. Such as marketing costs for individual products go down as you produce and advertise more products.

## Special cases for public and non profit organisations
Revenue streams are usually from donors and not at all or partially from customers.

One example: ITU which is paid by the state. So that's technically everyone, which also includes the "customers" (students). That is a weird case with state organisations. You pay taxes from your pay, which indirectly pays your pay.

## Example (organisation with physical products)
Example: Nespresso

  - Machine
  - Coffee pods
- Customer segments
  - Households
- Key partners
  - Machine manufacturers
  - Coffee growers
- Channels
  - Retail

  - Nespresso store
- Key resources
  - Distribution Channels
  - Patents
  - Coffee
  - Production facilities
  - Marketing and branding
- Customer relationships
  - Acquire & lock in
- Revenue streams
  - Machine sales
  - Repetetive pod sales
- Cost structure
  - Production
  - Marketing and branding
  - B2C distribution

## Approaches
### Checklist
Looking at the blocks individually. Not very good.

### Only looking at innovation or new customer segments
This would overlook new methods and make you open for front/back stage disruption and profit formulat disruptions.

### No testing approach
Being so happy about you idea that you make business plans instead of just testing the product, which would maybe show it failing or showing new methods and models that you could use to disrupt the existing market.
