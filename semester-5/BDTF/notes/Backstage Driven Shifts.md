# Backstage Driven Shifts
A radical shift in how value is created for the customer.

## Patterns
### From Dedicated Resources to Multi-Usage Resources
Using one resource meant for one value proposition in an entirely different value proposition.

### From Asset Heavy to Asset Light
Moving from a lot high fixed costs to asset-light with variable costs. The new capital can be invested in growth.

### From Closed to Open
Moving from a closed approach to development to an open outside-in approach. You could for example share R and D, as Tesla did with their battery tech.
