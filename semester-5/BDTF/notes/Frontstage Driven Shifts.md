# Frontstage Driven Shifts
A radical change in who your customers are and how you deliver that product/service.

## Patterns
### From Niche Market to Mass Market
Move from a small customer segment to a large one. Requires simplifying the value proposition to be less niche and more broad.

### From B2B to B2(B2)C
Move from a business to business model to a business to business to consumer model. Can also cut out the middle man completely. This is mostly focused on becoming more relevant to the consumer. See IBM.

### From Low Touch to High Touch
Move from small interactions to many interactions with the customer. Could be from no to personal trainers.
