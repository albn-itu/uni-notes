# Frontstage Disruption 
A radical change of who is targeted and how value is delivered

## Patterns
### Market Explorers
Unlocks untapped and underserved markets with new value propositions. Thereby exploiting markets with large potential.

**Examples**

- Visionaries (Tesla)
- Repurposer (M-Pesa, mobile phone based money transfer)
- Democratiser (Sears & Roebuck, deparment store)

### Channel Kings
Change how to reach and acquire a large number of new customers. Essentially changing recruitment strategy. This is done by exploiting new channels that haven't been used before.

**Examples**

- [[Disintermediators]] (Barberskabet.dk, subscription based shaving blades)(Tesla)
- Opportunity Builders (Tupperware)(Estaldo)

### Gravity creators
Create switching costs. Google and Apple are big in this space. By turning transactional sales into long term relationships, you lock the customer to your company. Software as a service is essentially this concept.

**Examples**

- Base Prduct & Consumable Trap: Sell a cheap base product and trap customers with consumables
  - Nespresso machines, the entirety of the fucking printer market, Gilette's razors
- Data Trap: We have your data now, and moving it is going to be complicated. 
  - Apple, Google, Spotify, Nemlig.com
- Learning Curve Trap: Getting into this product is difficult, so learning another is a huge and costly endevaor.
  - Adobe
  - Salesforce
- Industry Standards Trap: We're what everyone uses, so you need us to do any work
  - Microsoft
  - Adobe
- Servitization Trap: Get locked into a service, such that you have to stay to actually provide your service. Such as paying monthly, renting etc.
  - Rolls Royce (jet engine department)
- Exit Trap: Lock in for a period, usually with a contract. Tele companies are a big contributor to this.
  - TCD, Easy, Tellmore
- Convenience Trap: Much like data trap, the current software is just way too convenient to switch.
  - Apple, Google
