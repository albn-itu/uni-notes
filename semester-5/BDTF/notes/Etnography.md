# Etnography
The belief that two parts of whole cannot always be understood seperatly.

There are 4 main principles of etnography:

- Natural Settings
  - Etnography is mostly focused on field work. Therefore there should be no artificial settings and the researcher should be able to observe the natural setting.
- Holism
  - Because of the belief that two parts are not always seperate, etnography focusses on the whole. This is why you should observe in the natural setting, as you then do not eliminate anything from the larger context.
- Descriptive
  - Etnography is descriptive, meaning that it describes the natural setting and the people in it. It does not try to explain or interpret the data. It also does not try to say how people should behave.
- Members' Point-of-View
  - Etnography is focused on the view of the subject, not the view of the researcher onto the subject.

## Methods
- Observation
  - The most important method of etnography is observation. The researcher should observe the natural setting and the people in it. This can be done by being a participant in the setting, or by being an observer.
  - The researcher should try not to interfere with the setting, only understanding, describing and observing it.
  - What people say and what they do is not the same thing
  - Participating has it's own problems, as you should write field notes, which become difficult when participating, this leads to writing notes, that are actually recollections of the events.
  - Note taking: Take notes of what you see and hear. This is important, as it allows you to remember what you saw and heard. It also allows you to go back and check your observations.
  - Videotaping: Same as note taking but far more accurate and you can go back to observe even more.
- Interviewing
  - Interviewing is a method that allows you to get more information from the people you are observing. It is important to note that you should not ask leading questions, as this will influence the answers of the interviewe.
  - Be careful with this method as it what people say and what they do is not the same thing.
  - Very useful if used along observation.
  - Location: Usually in the local setting as they are more comfortable and can access people relevent to the interview.
  - Who: As many different people from the community as possible.

Things to keep in mind:

- Influence as little as possible. So don't promise much in return for the participant.
