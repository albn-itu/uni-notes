# Experiment

Testing is important to prove or disprove your hypothesis, and therefore learn whether it's even possible to turn the idea into a business.

## Rules of thumb
There are 4 rules of thumb to keep in mind:

- Go cheap and fast in the beginning: You simply need to prove that it's worth pursuing, don't waste too many resources on testing
- Increase the strength of evidence with multiple experiments on the same hypothesis: One test may not be enough to prove or disprove your hypothesis
- Always pick the experiment that produces the strongest evidence, given your constraints: Strong evidence is best
- Reduce uncertainty as much as you can before you build: Building is expensive, so test as much as possible before doing anything else.
