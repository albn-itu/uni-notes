# Design - Test (loop) 
Phases in order:
- [[Desirability]] (Do they want it?)
- Feasible (Can we do it?)
- Viable (Should we do it?)

## Desirability
Look at the environment, use the 4 Key Factors Performance Assesment

## Feasible
To test the feasibility of the idea use the Trigger questions for Disruption and Shift. The Business Model can then be evaluated using the [[Assesment Questions]]. 

[[Experiment Selection]]

## Viable
And lastly design the value propositions.

Use [[Assumption Mapping]] of the Key Hypothesis, the Experiments and the key inisghts to reduce uncertainty and risk.

## Scoring it all
