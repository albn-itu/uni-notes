# Design - Test (loop) 
## Design phases
### Ideate
List as many alternative ways as possible to turn your idea into a proper business

### Business prototype
Narrow down ideate with prototypes of value propositions and business model canvasses.

### Assess
Assess the design of your prototype using assessment questions. If you are satisfied move onto test, or start over to iterate on the idea.

## Testing phases
### [[Hypothesize]]
Come up with everything that needs to be true for the idea to work. Break it into small testable pieces.

### Experiment
Test your hypothesis with experiments. One would ususally look for the following elements

#### [[Desirability]] - Do they want it?
Look at the environment, use the 4 Key Factors Performance Assesment

#### Feasible - Can we do it?
To test the feasibility of the idea use the Trigger questions for Disruption and Shift. The Business Model can then be evaluated using the [[Assesment Questions]]. 

[[Experiment Selection]]

#### Viable - Should we do it?
And lastly design the value propositions.

Use [[Assumption Mapping]] of the Key Hypothesis, the Experiments and the key inisghts to reduce uncertainty and risk.

#### Scoring it all
[[Innovation Metrics and Innovation Project Scoreboard]]

[[Innovation Project Score Card]]

### Learn

Analyze the results of the experiments. The results determine whether or not to perservere, pivot or kill.
