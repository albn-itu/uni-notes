# Team Design
Team design is incredibly important when building a business. It is the foundation of your business and the most important thing you can do to ensure your business is successful.

You should focus on the following things:

- Cross-Functional Skillsets: You should have a team that is able to ship the product and learn from customers, so both market analytics, engineering and design is important
- Access To Missing Skills: If you cannot get humans with the skillset try to use tech to fill the void.
- Testing Tools: Test new tools to see if you can use them instead of a person
- Entrepreneurial Experience: Many entreprenurs need alot of experience before finding success.
- Diversity: Team diversity is important to ensure you have a team that can think outside the box and solve problems in different ways.
