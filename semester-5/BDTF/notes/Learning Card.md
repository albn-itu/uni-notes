# Learning Card
A learning card links to a test card and shows what we observed, what we learned from that and what we will do now. A test card can have many learning cards. Actions should be based on your Confidence level in the test data. Some tests have much conflicting evidence which can confuse the result. The confidence level can also be a result of many tests on the same hypothesis, so if many tests have the same result you should have high confidence, but if only one gives you that result you should probably be skeptical.
