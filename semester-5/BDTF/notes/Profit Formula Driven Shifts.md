# Profit Formula Driven Shifts
A radical change in how profits are made.

## Patterns
### From High Cost to Low Cost
The shift toward more efficient activities and resources. This may have consequences for the value proposition, but that could attract more customers.

### From Transactional to Recurring Revenue
Moving from one time sales to a one time sale that locks in customers and then takes recurring revenue from them. See Ring fx.

### From Conventional to Contrarian
Reduce cost and increase value at the same time by eliminating the most costly Key ... from the model, even if it may have an effect on the Value Proposition
