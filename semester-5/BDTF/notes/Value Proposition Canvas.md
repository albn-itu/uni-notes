# Value Proposition Canvas
A tool for defining the value proposition of a product or service. It has two sides. A side with the Customer Profile and a side with the Value Map that describes how you create value for the customer. To achieve Fit have the two sides meet.

## Customer Profile
Describes the customer segment the business model is targeting. It has 3 areas. Jobs (What is the customer trying to do?), Gains (What benefits are the customer seeking?) and Pains (What pains is there in the customers job?).

### Element - Jobs
There are 3 types of jobs:
- Functional Jobs: A task or problem the customer is trying to solve.
- Social Jobs: How the customer wants to be seen by others.
- Personal/Emotional Jobs: How the customer wants to feel.

There are supporting jobs too:
- Buyer of value: Jobs related to buying a product/service. This includes task such as comparing products and standing in line.
- Cocreator of value: Job related to cocreating value with an organisation. This includes tasks such as sharing information, participating in a community or writing reviews.
- Transferrer of value: Job related to the end of the job. This includes tasks such as disposing of a product or service, cancelling subscriptions, reselling, etc.

Jobs should be prioritised by importance, according to the customer. What you might think is important may not be what the customer wants. It's important to acknowledge that jobs do not have the same importance.

Jobs have a context they usually have to be done in. This context can create constraints, such as regolatory, compliance, safety etc.

### Element - Pains
Pains are things that annoy the customer while, before or after the job. There are essentially 3 types of pains:
- Undesired outcomes, problems and characteristics
  - Functional: This doesn't work well
  - Social: This makes me look bad
  - Personal/Emotional: This makes me feel bad
  - Ancillary: Annoying
  -Undesired characteristics: It's boring
- Obstacles: Things that get in the way of getting the job done.
- Risks: Negative consequences or outcomes that could happen.

Pains should be ranked in terms of their severity.

### Element - Gains
Gains are things or benefits the customer wants to achieve. There are 4 types of gains in ranked order:
- Required gains: The customer needs to achieve the job.
- Expected gains: Basic gains the customer just expects to exist.
- Desired gains: Gains the customer would like to have.
- Unexpected gains: Gains the customer didn't know they wanted.

These are ranked in order of importance.

### Ranking
Each element has it's own ranking, these should then be ranked in one big pile. This pile should be tested thoroughly to ensure it reflects the customers ranking.

## Value Map
Describes the features of a Value Proposition in your business model. It has 3 areas. Gain Creators (How you create gains), Pain Relievers (How your products alleviate pains) and a list of Services/Products that the Value Proposition is built around.

### Element - Products and Services
This is a list of the products and services that the Value Proposition is built around. These should be prioritised by relevevance to the customer. Remember that a product or service doesn't create value alone, only in relation to the customer and their jobs, pains and gaing.

There are 4 types of products and services:
- Physical/Tangible: A physical product that can be touched.
- Intangible: Copyrights or services such as assistance
- Digital: Software, apps, websites, etc.
- Financial: Insurance or financing services (Klarna)

### Element - Pain Relievers
Pain relievers are the parts of products or services that alleviate pains. Should be prioritised by relevance to the customer.

### Element - Gain Creators
Gain creators are the parts of products or services that create gains. Should be prioritised by relevance to the customer.

## A great value proposition
Here are 10 characteristics of a great value proposition:

- Embedded in a great business model
