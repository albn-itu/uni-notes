# Ecosystem
An ecosystem is a collection of businesses that work towards the same goal. There is not only competetion in such a system, but also cooperation. You cannot create a good business without also cooperating.

An ecosystem usually has a leader, this leader is a benefit for the entire ecosystem, as all the participants can work towards a goal with that leader. Microsoft fx. is a leader in the Operating Systems ecosystem.

Every ecosystem develops in 4 different stages:

- Birth
  - Explore and define what new customers want.
  - Victory goes to the first to market.
  - In this stage cooperation is rewarded, as it makes it easier to get to market, and can help to have followers further down the stages.
- Expansion
  - Expand the ecosystem to new customers and a larger market by scaling supply.
  - Victory goes to the first to scale.
  - This stage is all about cooperation as scaling is hard on your own. At the same time you must attempt to eliminate similar ideas and ensure that your approach becomes standard.
- Leadership
  - Create a vision for the future of the ecosystem that your partners will follow, and that new partners will join.
  - Competetively you have to maintain the strongest position in the ecosystem.
- Self-renewal or death
  - The ecosystem must constantly reinvent itself to stay relevant. You must work with your partners and new innovators to create the newer ecosystem
  - Competetively you should maintain a high barrier to entry that blocks new innovators, forcing them to work with you. Also have high switching costs to buy yourself time.
