# AES
Advanced Encryption Standard

AES is a [[Block Cipher]]

Block length = 128 bits

Key length = 128,192 or 256 bits

Number of rounds = 10,12 or 14

Contains a Byte Substitution, Diffusion and Key Addition Layer.

## Security
No practical attack is currently known on AES, when AES is correctly implemented. The implementation is easier to attack than the cipher.

Is considered secure because it's believed to be a good pseudorandom permutation function.
