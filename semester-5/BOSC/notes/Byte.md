# Byte
A byte consists of 8 bits. Historically a byte was used to encode a single character of text in [[ASCII]], this is also why a byte is usually the smallest addressable unit of [[Memory]].

## Larger units
Just like bits, there are multiple ways to define larger units of bytes. One is based on powers of 10 and uses the usual SI unit prefixes (kilo, mega, giga, ...), and symbols (k, M, G, ...). A different system is based on powers of 2, these use binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, ...) and symbols (Ki, Mi, Gi, ...)
