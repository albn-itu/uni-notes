# File
A file is a [[File descriptor]], which is just a name of the file, and an array of bytes. The array of bytes IS the file. In Linux everything is a file [[Memory]], [[IO]] everything. Most device files are located in `/dev`.

## Text files
A text file is a subset of files which only contain [[ASCII]] characters, these are still bytes but can be parsed as ASCII text.

## Binary files
A binary file just contain binary data, this can sometimes be parsed to create text files, or pdf files and so on. Its not readable to humans, at least without way too much effort.
