# Bit
Bits are the lowest representation of data in computers. A bit is simply 0 or 1, they are essentially just an electrical signal being either on or off.

## Larger units
There are multiple ways to define larger units of bytes. One is based on powers of 10 and uses the usual SI unit prefixes (kilo, mega, giga, ...), and symbols (k, M, G, ...). A different system is based on powers of 2, these use binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, ...) and symbols (Ki, Mi, Gi, ...)
