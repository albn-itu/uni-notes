# ASCII
ASCII is a way to represent bits to translate them into the characters we all know and love. An ASCII character is just 8 [[Bit]]s, or one [[Byte]]. 

ASCII is just an [[Encoding]] of bits, there are many encoding standards, but ASCII was one of the first. It's showing its age and is quite outdated, its been surpassed by the much more popular UTF-8.
